Run './war.py <setupfile> <outfile>' and give <outfile> to the playback machine ('./pbm.py <outfile>').

The ships orders are determined by the Order functions, themselves determined by order_list, found in war.py. Only the first two items in order_list are ever used. Change these to the name of the orders functions desired.

The order functions themselves are best defined in players/<player_name>.py, just because that's what I decided is best. You'll need to edit players/__init__.py and tell it to import your player ('import <player_name>' should work). Then, just make one of the entries in order_list point to your desired order function, usually '<player_name>.Order'.


Your order function must conform to the following:
* It accepts one argument, a list of Sensor objects, one per ship in the universe.
* It returns an Orders object.


Sensor objects have the following variables:
* Sensor.dist: 	    distance from sensing ship to sensed ship.
* Sensor.phase:	    angle from sensing ship to sensed ship, in degrees.
* Sensor.id:	    id of the sensed ship (1 or 2, depending on team).
* Sensor.vel:	    velocity of sensed ship, as a complex number (real=x, imag=y).
* Sensor.d:	    direction of sensed ship, in degrees.
* Sensor.rad:	    radius of sensed ship (always 100, for now).
* Sensor.power:	    power of sensed ship.
* Sensor.fuel:	    fuel of sensed ship.

dist, phase, vel, and d are all sensed relative to the sensing ship. That is, as though the sensing ship were the origin, and the sensing ships direction were 0 degrees.

Your ship is not given special attention (this may change). To find your ship, you should search for the sensed ship at distance 0.

All numbers are rounded (actually, cast to ints) before being reported. This means that the farther away a ship is, the less accurate the phase is for positioning it absolutely. This is cool!


Orders objects have the following variables:
* Orders.turn: 	    number of degrees to turn.
* Orders.thrust:    amount to thrust.
* Orders.fire:	    if true, create a bullet that lasts for a number of frames = fire.

turn is limited to -3 <= turn <= 3.

thrust is unlimited, but the thrust amount is subtracted from your fuel. (Also note: The thrust you give is divided by 100 before the ship deals with it. This makes things simpler, as thrust=1 is a sane amount.)

fire, like thrust, is unlimited, but subtracted from your power. Note that bullets travel at 20 units per frame.

Any order that cannot be completed as ordered, will instead be completed to the best of a ships ability.
